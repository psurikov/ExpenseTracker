# Expense Tracker

## About
This is a test project that demonstrates expense tracker from an assignment.

## How to launch
This project has not been deployed to any environment; you are currently viewing the source code. Unlike end-users who would interact with an HTTP endpoint, the responsibility of deployment falls to you. To proceed, please configure multiple startup projects (both client and server) and initiate debugging in Visual Studio by clicking on the Solution->Properties->Startup Project option.

## Limitations
Vite proxy server takes time launch and depending on the order of projects startup, the client may not access server immediately (backend). Therefore, in such a case you might see a message asking to refresh the page. Please click on the refresh hyperlink and wait until the server is up.
